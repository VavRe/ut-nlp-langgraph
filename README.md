# NLP Workshop 3: Medical Support Chatbot Using LangGraph

This repository contains materials from Workshop 3, conducted as part of the NLP Course by Dr. Heshaam Faili in the ECE Department of University of Tehran, Spring 2024.

## Workshop Overview

The workshop was divided into three main parts:

1. **Fundamental Concepts**: We reviewed key concepts and fundamentals of NLP through a series of slides and discussions.

2. **Hands-on Project**: We implemented a medical support chatbot using LangChain, LangGraph, and LLaMa-70B-Instruct. This mini-project applied the concepts covered in the first part.

3. **Q&A Session**: An interactive session where participants could ask questions and discuss the covered topics.
